Vardhaman Bot
=============
This is a Rasa NLU based chatbot created by Utor AI that functions as a personal assistant to the students of Vardhaman College of Engineering.

## Installing Dependencies and Running the chatbot
The utorai/botbase docker image has all necessary dependencies which is the base image for our Dockerfile. So build the docker image and start a container with the docker image you just built and you should be all set.

## Contribute
Though the core development and maintenance is done by Utor AI, we encourage contributions from everyone.
